## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Leonardo Vinicius**, a guy who's trying to figure out which area to work in the middle of programming.

## Public Information

I'm based in Curitiba - PR, Brazil and I'm literally lost after finishing my International Relations college and finding out that it wasn't what I wanted.

To be honest, until today the choice of this course was a mystery, I've always seen programming with good eyes but never delved into it, then in 2023 I decided to really focus and see which area of â€‹â€‹programming I would fit in the best way, I still haven't this verdict. But I'm on the way.

Anyway, I hope I can find my way in technology and help people with it somehow.
